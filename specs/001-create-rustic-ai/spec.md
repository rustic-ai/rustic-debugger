   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: For historical message replay (FR-007), what should be the maximum time window users can query? ‚Üí A: 7 days (last week)
- Q: For the optional message replay capability (FR-012), who should have access to this feature? ‚Üí A: All developers with system access
- Q: For handling high-volume message streams (FR-013), what are the minimum performance targets? ‚Üí A: 100 messages/second with <500ms UI latency
- Q: What format should be used for exporting message sets (FR-010)? ‚Üí A: JSON only
- Q: When viewing high-volume streams and memory limits are reached, how should the system handle overflow? ‚Üí A: Drop oldest messages (FIFO)
- Q: When viewing high-volume message streams that exceed the 100 msg/s limit, what specific behavior should occur? ‚Üí A: Show warning banner + drop oldest messages (FIFO)
- Q: When Redis connection is lost during live tailing, how should the system handle reconnection? ‚Üí A: Immediate retry with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... up to 30s)
- Q: When multiple developers debug the same guild simultaneously, how should the system handle this? ‚Üí A: Both A and B - independent sessions with indicator
- Q: When a guild namespace is deleted while being debugged, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error and offer to switch to another guild
- Q: For the debugger's own cache data (not Redis data), what should be the retention policy? ‚Üí A: 7 days, user clearable

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer creating and debugging Guilds for RusticAI, I need to visualize and inspect the message flow through Redis in real-time and historically, so that I can diagnose issues, understand system behavior, and debug problems efficiently without interfering with production systems.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has access to a RusticAI system with active guilds, **When** they open the debugger, **Then** they can see a list of all available guild namespaces and their current activity levels
2. **Given** a developer selects a specific guild, **When** they view the message flow, **Then** they see a visual graph representation of messages flowing between topics and agents
3. **Given** a developer is viewing message flow, **When** they click on a specific message, **Then** they can inspect the full payload, routing history, and state changes
4. **Given** a developer wants to debug past issues, **When** they specify a time window, **Then** they can replay and inspect historical messages from that period
5. **Given** a developer detects an error pattern, **When** they apply filters for error status, **Then** they see only messages with error states and can trace the error source
6. **Given** a developer needs to analyze messages offline, **When** they select a filtered set of messages, **Then** they can export them for external analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when viewing high-volume message streams (thousands of messages per second)? System shows warning banner and drops oldest messages (FIFO) to maintain 100 msg/s limit
- How does system handle when Redis connection is lost during live tailing? System immediately retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s... up to 30s)
- What happens when requested historical data exceeds available memory? System drops oldest messages (FIFO)
- How does the system behave when multiple developers are debugging the same guild simultaneously? Each developer gets independent read-only session with "X other developers viewing" indicator
- What happens when a guild namespace is deleted while being debugged? System shows error notification and offers to switch to another guild

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all available guild namespaces in the connected Redis instance
- **FR-002**: System MUST visualize message flow between topics and agents as an interactive graph
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow real-time tailing of messages for selected guilds
- **FR-004**: System MUST display message volume and traffic patterns for each topic
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to inspect individual message details including payload, routing information, and state updates
- **FR-006**: System MUST support viewing conversation threads by linking related messages
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow historical message replay for up to 7 days (last week)
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to filter messages by topic, status, agent, and time range
- **FR-009**: System MUST highlight error messages and allow tracing of error patterns
- **FR-010**: System MUST support exporting filtered message sets in JSON format
- **FR-011**: System MUST operate in read-only mode by default to prevent production data modification
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide optional message replay capability accessible to all developers with system access
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle at least 100 messages/second with UI latency under 500ms
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain message ordering and timing accuracy during visualization
- **FR-015**: System MUST automatically reconnect and resume when connection to Redis is temporarily lost
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain cached data for 7 days and provide user option to clear cache

### Key Entities
- **Guild**: A namespace that groups related topics and agents, representing an isolated messaging environment
- **Topic**: A channel within a guild where messages are published and subscribed to by agents
- **Message**: A unit of communication containing payload data, routing information, unique ID, and timestamp
- **Agent**: An entity that processes messages from topics and may publish responses
- **Thread**: A linked sequence of related messages forming a conversation
- **ProcessStatus**: The execution state of a message (SUCCESS, ERROR, etc.)
- **RoutingSlip**: The path a message has taken through different agents and topics
