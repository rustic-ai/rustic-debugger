# Implementation Plan: Documentation Website with GitHub Pages

**Branch**: `002-setup-a-documentation` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/rohit/work/dragonscale/rustic-debug/specs/002-setup-a-documentation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → COMPLETED: Feature spec loaded and analyzed
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → COMPLETED: Project type detected as web (frontend+backend+docs)
3. Fill Constitution Check section
   → COMPLETED: All constitutional requirements verified as PASS
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section
   → COMPLETED: No violations, ready for Phase 0
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → COMPLETED: Technology decisions and research complete
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md
   → COMPLETED: All design artifacts generated
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → COMPLETED: Post-design check passed, no new violations
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach
   → COMPLETED: Task planning strategy defined
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
   → COMPLETED: All planning phases finished
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phase 2 is executed by /tasks command.

## Summary
Create a comprehensive documentation website hosted on GitHub Pages with automated screenshot generation for the Rustic Debug application. The site will provide separate sections for developer and user documentation, use rustic.ai theming for consistent branding, and support hierarchical navigation with manual screenshot updates triggered when needed.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+, Node.js 18+, React 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Vite, GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, Puppeteer/Playwright for screenshots
**Storage**: Static files (Markdown, HTML, images), no database required
**Testing**: Vitest for documentation build scripts, visual regression for screenshots
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (GitHub Pages static hosting)
**Project Type**: web - extends existing frontend/backend structure with docs/
**Performance Goals**: <3s page load, <5s screenshot generation, static site performance
**Constraints**: GitHub Pages limitations, manual screenshot triggers, public hosting only
**Scale/Scope**: ~50 documentation pages, hierarchical navigation, mobile-responsive design

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Read-Only by Default**: ✅ PASS - Documentation is inherently read-only, no write operations to production systems
**Separation of Concerns**: ✅ PASS - Documentation site is separate from main application, clear boundaries
**Type Safety First**: ✅ PASS - Build scripts will use TypeScript, screenshot automation typed
**Test-Driven Development**: ✅ PASS - Documentation build pipeline will have tests for generation process
**Performance by Design**: ✅ PASS - Static site hosting optimized for performance, CDN distribution
**Monorepo Structure**: ✅ PASS - Documentation fits into existing workspace structure as docs/ package
**Integration Constraints**: ✅ PASS - No modification of rustic-ai/ symlink, supplements existing functionality

```

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure extended with documentation package. Documentation website will be a separate workspace package (docs/) that generates static content for GitHub Pages deployment. The existing frontend/ and backend/ structure provides the source application for screenshot automation.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
**COMPLETED** ✅

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**: All technical decisions resolved through research
2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**: Technology stack analysis completed
3. **Consolidate findings**: All decisions documented in research.md

**Output**: ✅ research.md with comprehensive technology decisions and rationale

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
**COMPLETED** ✅

1. **Extract entities from feature spec**: Documentation entities defined in data-model.md
2. **Generate API contracts**: Build and deployment contracts created
3. **Generate contract tests**: Test strategies defined for build pipeline
4. **Extract test scenarios**: User stories converted to acceptance criteria
5. **Update agent file**: CLAUDE.md enhanced with documentation project context

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, contracts/*, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Documentation package setup tasks [P]
- Content structure creation tasks [P]
- Build system implementation tasks
- Screenshot automation setup tasks [P]
- GitHub Actions workflow implementation tasks
- Testing and validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Package setup, basic structure
- Core functionality: Build system, content processing
- Advanced features: Screenshots, optimization, deployment
- Validation: Testing, performance checks
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks (5-7 tasks)**: Package creation, dependencies, basic config
2. **Content Tasks (8-10 tasks)**: Content structure, markdown processing, navigation
3. **Build Tasks (6-8 tasks)**: Vite configuration, TypeScript, asset optimization
4. **Screenshot Tasks (4-5 tasks)**: Playwright setup, automation scripts, image optimization
5. **Deployment Tasks (3-4 tasks)**: GitHub Actions workflows, Pages configuration
6. **Testing Tasks (4-6 tasks)**: Build validation, screenshot tests, performance checks

**Estimated Output**: 30-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations requiring justification*

All constitutional requirements are met without any simplification needed:
- Documentation maintains read-only principle
- Clear separation from existing application code
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Performance optimized through static site generation

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
