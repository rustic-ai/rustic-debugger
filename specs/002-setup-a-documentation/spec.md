**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "setup a documentation website with gh-pages and generate dev and user docs with screenshots of all pages and views. use rustic.ai theme"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: documentation website, GitHub Pages, dev docs, user docs, screenshots, rustic.ai theme
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, end users, documentation maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: setup, generate, host, view, maintain documentation
   ‚Üí Data: screenshots, documentation content, code examples
   ‚Üí Constraints: use rustic.ai theme, GitHub Pages hosting
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific documentation structure and navigation]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: screenshot automation frequency and triggers]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: content update workflow and responsibilities]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: stakeholders accessing comprehensive project documentation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on documentation accessibility and maintenance
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Documentation pages, screenshots, user guides, developer guides
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding automation and maintenance"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

- Q: Who should be able to update the documentation content? ‚Üí A: Any team member with repository access
- Q: What type of navigation structure should the documentation website have? ‚Üí A: Hierarchical sidebar with nested sections

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a stakeholder (developer, product manager, or end user), I want to access comprehensive, up-to-date documentation for the Rustic Debug application so that I can understand how to use the system, contribute to development, or make informed decisions about the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new developer joining the project, **When** I visit the documentation website, **Then** I can find setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines
2. **Given** I am an end user, **When** I access the user documentation, **Then** I can see visual guides with screenshots showing how to use each feature of the application
3. **Given** I am a product stakeholder, **When** I review the documentation, **Then** I can see current screenshots that accurately reflect the application's interface and functionality
4. **Given** the application interface changes, **When** the documentation is updated, **Then** all screenshots are automatically refreshed to maintain accuracy
5. **Given** I am browsing the documentation on mobile or desktop, **When** I navigate through the site, **Then** the rustic.ai theme provides a consistent and professional experience

### Edge Cases
- What happens when screenshots become outdated due to UI changes?
- How does the system handle documentation for features that are in development?
- What occurs if the GitHub Pages deployment fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST host documentation on GitHub Pages with public accessibility
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide separate sections for developer documentation and user documentation
- **FR-003**: Documentation MUST include screenshots of all major application pages and views
- **FR-004**: Website MUST use rustic.ai theme for consistent branding and visual identity
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide manual trigger capability to generate and update screenshots when documentation maintainers determine updates are needed
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST include hierarchical sidebar navigation with nested sections allowing users to easily find relevant content
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain documentation versioning aligned with application releases
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST be searchable and include cross-references between related topics
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow any team member with repository access to update documentation content
- **FR-010**: Website MUST be responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Page**: Individual content units covering specific topics, containing text, images, and cross-references
- **Screenshot**: Visual representation of application interfaces, automatically captured and embedded in documentation
- **User Guide**: Documentation section focused on end-user functionality and workflows
- **Developer Guide**: Documentation section covering technical implementation, setup, and contribution processes
- **Navigation Structure**: Hierarchical organization of documentation content enabling logical browsing
